# hashtable_with_linkedlist_by_cpp
 hashtable to be created using C++. There are certain specifications that need to be followed for this project.
The hashtable should be a template class written in two separate files. A main file should be included with the template files.
The hashtable must be implemented using chaining and linkedlist.
Each hash bucket should have access to the head of a linkedlist. If the size of the linkedlist become 11 then it should be replaced by a binary search tree. On the other hand if the size of the binary search tree is reduced to 8 then it will be replaced by a linkedlist.
Create the rehash function that rehash the hashtable when the loadfactor is increased to a certain threshold.
The hashtable needs to have all the specifications completed and should be written as classes, not structs in separate files
